<h1>Welcome to EOClipse</h1>
<p>
This software is in its very early stage. We are working hard on it but we lack feedback.
</p>
<p>
If you plan on using this tool and have any request for a feature(s), please email us at <a href="mailto:metaaps@metaaps.com">metaaps(at)metaaps.com</a>
</p>
<p>
We will be glad to work on it straight away!
</p>
<p>
Of course if you want to participate in the project or even if you are looking for a serious GIS/Space Imagery consultant, feel free to contact us too!
